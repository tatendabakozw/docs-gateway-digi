# API Documentation

Use the Documentation API to access analysis, SDK, group messages, and more and seamlessly integrate your product into the workflows of dozens of devoted Gateway users.

## Getting Started

To get started, create a new application in your **[developer settings](https://payme-dashboard.vercel.app)**, then read about how to make requests for the resources you need to access using our HTTP APIs or dedicated client SDKs. When your integration is ready to go live, publish it to our **[integrations directory](https://payme-dashboard.vercel.app)** to reach the Gateway community.

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 18.0 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## Generate a new project

Generate a new Gaateway project using the **classic sdk**.

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
npm init @gateway/classic e-commerce
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
